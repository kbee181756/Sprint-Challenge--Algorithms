#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The algorithm will make a loop based on the size on n.   This will linear time.  O(n)


b) Based on the input size on n, the solution here is O(n^3)  n log n 


c) The solution in this case based on the size of n is O(n).  It will takes the same amount of time irrespective of the size of n

## Exercise II

Create two variables, (floor = 0), and eggbreaks = False.    Using a while loop, test to see if it meets to the condition of; if the condition is true, return the floor, if not, keep repeating the process while incrementing the level, until we reach the floor where the egg breaks.   The time complexity here is O(n).
